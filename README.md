# Bitshala Bitcoin Core PR Reviews

This is a PR review club organized by [Bitshala](https://www.bitshala.org/), in inspiration from [Bitcoin Core Reviews](https://bitcoincore.reviews/).

This club is organized every week Thursday on IST 20:00 (UTC 14:30) at [jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/BitshalaPRReviewClub) and is open
to all.

Majorly focused on Indian young developers who are willing to get into the details of Bitcoin Core but are intimidated with
all the C++ details. This club is meant to help such people to ease into Bitcoin Core Codebase. We understand it's always difficult
to get started with Bitcoin Core, and we intend to provide a helping hand in the process.

The conversations are over jitsi calls, informal and casual, and participants can choose not be visible in in video. The calls are recorded for future reference and guide for new entrants.
